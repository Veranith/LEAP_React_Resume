                <ul>
                    <li>I manage the workflow of our team by assigning tickets to technicians based on severity and SLA requirements of multiple ticket queues, and projects. Our team dependably exceeds our requirement of 95% SLA for a 99.999% uptime environment. Our datacenter is consistently in the top 10 Microsoft datacenters globally.</li>
                    <li>As a subject matter expert in many areas, I actively contribute to multiple task force teams and committees to improve documentation and policies which have a global impact to the company.</li>
                    <li>I frequently cross collaborate with a multitude of datacenter teams to resolve persistent break/fix and deployment issues which result in greatly accelerated resolution times.</li>
                    <li>I strive for process improvement to increase efficiency; most recently I authored a Power Shell tool to interface with our ticketing app, asset management app, Excel and e-mail.

            <h2> Volunteer Service Engineer, Meals on Wheels of Cheyenne, Cheyenne, WY	Oct 2017 – Present </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I volunteer as the lead I.T. support for the charity Meals on Wheels of Cheyenne. My team and I identified needed areas of improvement. We submitted a grant proposal and received funding from Microsoft for a digital transformation. Through this grant we have replaced their servers, networking equipment, added physical security systems, and upgraded their Cisco PBX telephone system.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing my network engineer training I replaced outdated network equipment as well as added new infrastructure to support the architectural needs for the digital transformation. Redesigned the network architecture to be more secure, reliable and to support the expanding digital footprint. This is the foundation for all current and future projects. </li>
                    <li>I deployed new servers in a highly redundant configuration to allow seamless operations. Utilizing virtual machines, I was able to upgrade the Active Directory forest to 2016 and establish a connection to Azure to create a hybrid cloud environment. With these improvements, I have implemented cloud backups with quick recovery, Azure AD authentication and migrated to Office 365. </li>
                    <li>Managed a project to transition from using an Access database to a custom app running C# and asp.net. Worked weekly with the primary users of the database and the development team to help create a new application that met the requirements and expectations of the staff. I deployed this new app to Azure using production and development sites. I now maintain the app and have learned some programming to be able to make minor improvements. </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>I lead a team of Break/Fix Datacenter Technicians responsible for all daily service activity, customer escalations, and service level agreements. Managing workflow was critical to ensure smooth operations. I was also the technical focus for the team and assisted with training and difficult technical issues for the team.</li>
                    <li>I was a critical contributor to the development of a new server troubleshooting tool by leading the piloting of this new tool in the Cheyenne datacenters. My in-depth knowledge of the servers used in Microsoft datacenters and my knowledge of PowerShell allowed me to understand how our former tool and the new tooling work to provide greater feedback and code updates. Through this contribution the Cheyenne campus was recognized as one of the sites providing the most beneficial feedback for the pilot program. My actions resulted in me receiving a GDCO impact award.  </li>
